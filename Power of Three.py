# Problem: Power of Three
# Determine whether a given integer n is a power of three.

"""
Approach ðŸš€

1. Handle base cases:
   - If n <= 0, return False because negative numbers and zero cannot be powers of 3.
   - If n == 1, return True because 3^0 = 1.
   - If n == 3, return True because 3^1 = 3.

2. For other cases:
   - Keep dividing n by 3 as long as it is divisible by 3 (n % 3 == 0).
   - After the loop ends, check if the result is equal to 1.
     If yes â†’ n is a power of 3.
     If no  â†’ n is not a power of 3.

Time Complexity: O(logâ‚ƒ n) â†’ because we keep dividing n by 3.
Space Complexity: O(1) â†’ only constant extra space is used.
